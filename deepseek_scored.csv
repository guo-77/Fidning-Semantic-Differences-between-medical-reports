The patient was then immediately set up for surgery.  After risks, complications, consequences, and questions were addressed with the patient, a written consent was obtained.,PROCEDURE:,  The patient was brought to the operative suite by Anesthesia and placed on the operative table in the supine position.  The patient was then placed under general endotracheal intubation anesthesia and the patient then had a shoulder roll placed.  After this, the patient then had the area marked initially.  The preoperative setting was then localized with 1% lidocaine and epinephrine 1:100,000 approximately 10 cc total.  After this, the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A #15 Bard-Parker was then utilized to make a skin incision horizontally, approximately 5 cm on either side from midline.  After this, a blunt dissection was then utilized to dissect the subcutaneous fat from the platysmal muscle.  There appeared to be a natural dehiscence of the platysma in the midline.  A sub-platysmal dissection was then performed in the superior, inferior, and lateral directions with the help of a bear claw, Metzenbaum scissors and DeBakey forceps.  Any bleeding was controlled with monopolar cauterization.  After this, the two anterior large jugular veins were noted and resected laterally.  The patient's trachea appeared to be slightly deviated to the right with identification finally of the midline raphe, off midline to the right.  This was grasped on either side with a DeBakey forceps and dissected with monopolar cauterization and dissected with a Metzenbaum scissors.  After this was dissected, the sternohyoid muscles were resected laterally and separated from the sternothyroid muscles.  The sternothyroid muscles were then bluntly freed and dissected from the right thyroid gland.  After this, attention was then drawn to the left gland, where the sternothyroid muscle was dissected bluntly on this side utilizing finger dissection and Kitners.  The left thyroid gland was freed initially superiorly and worked inferiorly and laterally until the gland was pulled from the substernal region by blunt dissection and reflected and pulled anteriorly.  After this, the superior and inferior parathyroid glands were noted.  The dissection was carried very close to the thyroid gland to try to select these parathyroids posteriorly.  After this, the superior pole was then identified and the superior laryngeal artery and vein were cross clamped and tied with __________ undyed Vicryl tie.  The superior pole was finally freed and a small little feeding branched vessels from this area were cauterized with the bipolar cautery and cut with Metzenbaum scissors.  After this, the thyroid gland was further freed down to the level of the Berry's ligament inferiorly and the dissection was carried once again more superiorly.  The fine stats were then utilized to dissect along the superior aspect of the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left side with freeing of the connective Berry's ligament tissue from the gland with the bipolar cauterization and the fine stat.  Finally, attention was then drawn back to the patient's right side where the gland was rotated more anteriorly with fine dissection utilizing a fine stat to reflect the superior and inferior parathyroid glands laterally and posteriorly.  The recurrent laryngeal nerve on this side was identified and further dissection was carried superiorly and anteriorly through this nerve to finally free the right side of the gland to Berry's ligament.  The middle thyroid vein and inferior thyroid arteries were cross clamped and tied with #2-0 undyed Vicryl ties and also bipolared with the bipolar cauterization bilaterally.  The Berry's ligament was then finally freed and the gland was then passed to scrub tech and passed off the field to Pathology.  The neck was then thoroughly irrigated with normal saline solution and further bleeding was controlled with bipolar cauterization.  After this, Surgicel was then placed in the bilateral neck regions and a #10 Jackson-Pratt drain was then placed within the left neck region with some extension over to the right neck region.  This was brought out through the inferior skin incision and secured to the skin with a #2-0 nylon suture.  The strap muscles were then reapproximated with a running #3-0 Vicryl suture followed by reapproximation of the platysma and subcutaneous tissue with a #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The skin was then reapproximated with a #5-0 Prolene subcuticular along with a #6-0 fast over the top.  After this, Mastisol Steri-Strips and Bacitracin along with a sterile dressing and a __________ dressing were then placed.  The patient intraoperatively did have approximately 50 cc of bloody drainage from this area within the JP drain.  The patient was then turned back to Anesthesia, extubated in the operating room and transferred to Recovery in stable condition.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Thyroid goiter with substernal extension on the left.  
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Total thyroidectomy with removal of substernal extension on the left.  
THIRD ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.  
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Around 200 cc.  
COMPLICATIONS: None observed.  
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient, a 54-year-old Caucasian male, had a history of an enlarged thyroid gland and initially visited the office with complaints of difficulty swallowing and breathing issues when lying on his back. A subsequent CT scan revealed a significantly enlarged thyroid, particularly on the left, extending below the sternum to the level of the aortic arch. The patient was promptly scheduled for surgery after discussing potential risks, complications, and obtaining informed written consent.  
PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room by Anesthesia and positioned supine on the surgical table. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, and a shoulder roll was placed. The operative area was marked, and a local anesthetic of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 was injected, totaling approximately 10 cc. The patient was then prepped and draped in the standard sterile manner. A horizontal skin incision of approximately 5 cm from the midline was created using a #15 Bard-Parker blade. Blunt dissection was used to separate subcutaneous fat from the platysmal muscle, which showed a natural midline separation. A sub-platysmal dissection was conducted superiorly, inferiorly, and laterally using a bear claw, Metzenbaum scissors, and DeBakey forceps, with bleeding controlled by monopolar cauterization. The two large anterior jugular veins were retracted laterally. The trachea was slightly deviated to the right, and the midline raphe was identified, grasped with DeBakey forceps, and dissected using monopolar cauterization and Metzenbaum scissors. The sternohyoid muscles were retracted laterally and separated from the sternothyroid muscles, which were bluntly dissected from the right thyroid gland. Attention then shifted to the left gland, where the sternothyroid muscle was bluntly dissected with finger dissection and Kitners. The left thyroid gland was freed superiorly and dissected inferiorly and laterally until it was removed from the substernal space by blunt dissection and moved anteriorly. The superior and inferior parathyroid glands were identified, and the dissection was conducted close to the thyroid gland to preserve these glands. The superior pole was identified, and the superior laryngeal artery and vein were cross-clamped and tied with undyed Vicryl. The superior pole was freed, and small feeding vessels were cauterized with bipolar cautery and severed with Metzenbaum scissors. The thyroid gland was further freed to the Berry's ligament inferiorly, and dissection continued superiorly. Fine stats were used to dissect along the superior portion of the recurrent laryngeal nerve on the left, freeing the connective tissue of Berry's ligament from the gland with bipolar cautery and fine stats. Attention then returned to the right side of the gland, which was rotated anteriorly with fine dissection using fine stats to reflect the parathyroid glands laterally and posteriorly. The recurrent laryngeal nerve on this side was identified, and dissection proceeded superiorly and anteriorly to free the right side of the gland to Berry's ligament. The middle thyroid vein and inferior thyroid arteries were cross-clamped, tied with #2-0 undyed Vicryl, and cauterized with bipolar cautery bilaterally. Berry's ligament was finally released, and the gland was passed to the scrub tech and then to Pathology. The neck was thoroughly irrigated with normal saline, and any bleeding was controlled with bipolar cautery. Surgicel was placed in both neck regions, and a #10 Jackson-Pratt drain was positioned in the left neck area, extending to the right neck. It was secured to the skin with a #2-0 nylon suture. The strap muscles were reapproximated with a running #3-0 Vicryl suture, followed by reapproximation of the platysma and subcutaneous tissue with #4-0 undyed Vicryl. The skin was closed with #5-0 Prolene subcuticular stitches, along with #6-0 fast stitches on top. Mastisol Steri-Strips, Bacitracin, and a sterile dressing were applied. Intraoperatively, the patient had approximately 50 cc of bloody drainage in the JP drain. The patient was then returned to Anesthesia, extubated in the operating room, and transferred to Recovery in a stable condition. The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient remained stable throughout.",Paraphrased, Surgery,MTSamples,10.0

I proceeded to do the palate repair.  The nature of the palate repair was done in the same way on the both sides.  I will describe one side.  The other side was done exactly in the same manner.  The 2 hemiuvulas are placed, holding from a single hook and infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000, triangle in the nasal mucosa was previously marked.  This triangle of nasal mucosa was removed and excised.  This was done on both uvulas.  Then, an incision was done at the level of the palatal cleft at the junction of the nasal and oral mucosa.  A 1-mm cuff of oral mucosa was used to be able to approximate the nasal mucosa better.  Once the incision was done up to the level of the hard palate, the muscle was dissected off the surrounding tissue, 2 mm from the nasal and the oral mucosa.  Then, I proceeded to place an incision at the alveolopalatal junction with the help of 15-blade.  The incision starts at the maxillary tuberosity posteriorly and comes anteriorly at the alveolopalatal junction through the full thickness of mucoperiosteal flap.  Then the flap was lifted up with the help of a freer, and then the remaining of the incision medially was completed.  Hemostasis was achieved with help of electrocautery and Surgicel.  The mucoperiosteal flap was retracted posteriorly with the help of a freer elevator.  The greater auricular foramen was exposed, and the pedicle skeletonized to allow medial retraction of the mucoperiosteal flap.  Then an osteotomy was done at the level of the greater auricular foramen to allow mobilization of the pedicle medially as well as a small incision was done in the periosteum around the pedicle.  The pedicle carefully dissected to allow better mobilization of the mucoperiosteal flap medially.  This procedure was done on both sides in the same manner, and then __________ dissection was done including dissection of the hard palate from the nasal mucosa, it was evident that the nasal mucosa would not reach medially to be placed together.  At this point, the decision was made to proceed with vomer flaps.  The flaps are __________ infiltrated the vomer with the help of lidocaine with epinephrine after an incision in the manner of an open book.  The incision was done with a 15C blade.  The vomer flaps were dissected, and the mucosa was moved laterally to approximate to the nasal mucosa of the hard palate.  This was approximated on both sides with 5-0 chromic running and interrupted stitches, and I proceeded to the remaining of the posterior aspect of the nasal mucosa with a 5-0 chromic and a 4-0 chromic.  Then 2 stitches of 4-0 Vicryl were applied to the soft palate in the Delaire manner through the full thickness of the mucosa and muscle on one side, on the other side, and then coming back on the mucosa to evert the edges of the soft palate.  The remaining part of the soft palate was placed together with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 chromic interrupted stitches.  The throat pack was removed.  The palate was cleaned.  The Dingman retractor was removed, and a single stitch after infiltration of lidocaine without epinephrine at the level of the midline of the tongue was applied with 2-0 silk to the dorsal aspect of the tongue and attached to the right cheek with a piece of Tegaderm.

COMPLICATIONS: None.  
ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia.  
CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AT THE END OF THE PROCEDURE: Stable, extubated, and moved to the recovery room in stable condition.  
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient, a 10-month-old infant, has a history of bilateral cleft lip and palate. The patient previously underwent cleft lip repair and is now presenting for cleft palate surgery. The procedure, along with its nature, risks, and benefits, was discussed with the mother. Potential risks include bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, and the possibility of future revision surgeries. The decision was made to proceed with the surgery.  
DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought into the operating room and placed supine. General anesthesia was administered, and a prophylactic dose of antibiotics was given. Bilateral PE tube placement was performed by Dr. X from the Ear, Nose, and Throat department. Once completed, the head of the bed was rotated 90 degrees, and the patient was positioned with a shoulder roll and doughnut. A Dingman retractor was placed, and the operative site was infiltrated with 3 mL of lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 before prepping and draping. The palate repair was executed symmetrically on both sides; I will describe one side, as the procedures were identical. The 2 hemiuvulas were held by a single hook and infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000. A previously marked triangle of nasal mucosa was excised from both uvulas. An incision was made at the palatal cleft junction of the nasal and oral mucosa, utilizing a 1-mm cuff of oral mucosa for better approximation of the nasal mucosa. Following the incision to the hard palate, the muscle was dissected 2 mm from the nasal and oral mucosa. An incision at the alveolopalatal junction was made using a 15-blade, starting at the maxillary tuberosity posteriorly and extending anteriorly through the mucoperiosteal flap. The flap was lifted with a freer, and the remaining incision was completed medially. Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery and Surgicel. The mucoperiosteal flap was retracted posteriorly using a freer elevator, exposing the greater auricular foramen, and the pedicle was skeletonized to permit medial retraction of the flap. An osteotomy was performed at the greater auricular foramen to facilitate medial mobilization of the pedicle, accompanied by a small incision in the periosteum surrounding the pedicle. The pedicle was dissected carefully for better medial mobilization of the flap. This procedure was mirrored on both sides. Upon dissection of the hard palate from the nasal mucosa, it was clear that the nasal mucosa would not approximate medially, prompting the decision to use vomer flaps. The vomer was infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine following an incision in an open book fashion using a 15C blade. Vomer flaps were dissected, and the mucosa was moved laterally to align with the nasal mucosa of the hard palate. This alignment was secured on both sides with 5-0 chromic running and interrupted sutures. The remaining posterior nasal mucosa was closed with 5-0 chromic, and a 4-0 chromic. Two 4-0 Vicryl stitches were placed in the soft palate in the Delaire manner, through the full thickness of the mucosa and muscle, to evert the edges. The remaining soft palate was approximated with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 chromic interrupted sutures. After removing the throat pack, the palate was cleansed, the Dingman retractor removed, and a single stitch was placed with 2-0 silk on the midline of the tongue, securing it to the right cheek with Tegaderm after infiltration of lidocaine without epinephrine. The procedure was completed without complications. BSS was applied to the eye after removing the Tegaderm. I was present and engaged in all aspects of the procedure. A final count of sponges, needles, and instruments was accurate.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bilateral cleft lip and bilateral cleft of the palate. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Repair of bilateral cleft of the palate with vomer flaps. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 40 mL. COMPLICATIONS: None. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. CONDITION OF THE PATIENT AT THE END OF THE PROCEDURE: Stable, extubated, and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 10-month-old baby with a history of a bilateral cleft of the lip and palate. The patient has undergone cleft lip repair and is here today for her cleft palate operation. We have discussed with the mother the nature of the procedure, risks, and benefits, including risks of bleeding, infection, dehiscence, scarring, and the need for future revision surgeries. We will proceed with surgery. 

DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought into the operating room and positioned supine, with general anesthesia administered. A prophylactic dose of antibiotics was given. The patient then underwent bilateral PE tube placement by Dr. X from Ear, Nose, and Throat Surgery. Following this, the head of the bed was rotated 90 degrees. The patient was positioned with a shoulder roll and doughnut, and a Dingman retractor was applied. The surgical area was infiltrated with 3 mL of lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000, and then prepping and draping were performed. The palate repair was carried out symmetrically on both sides; I will describe one side, with the other performed identically. The 2 hemiuvulas were held from a single hook and infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000; a triangle in the nasal mucosa was marked and excised on both uvulas. An incision was made at the palatal cleft junction of the nasal and oral mucosa, leaving a 1-mm cuff of oral mucosa to better approximate the nasal mucosa. This incision extended to the hard palate, with muscle dissected from the surrounding tissue 2 mm from the nasal and oral mucosa. An incision at the alveolopalatal junction was made using a 15-blade, beginning at the maxillary tuberosity posteriorly and extending anteriorly through the mucoperiosteal flap. This flap was elevated with a freer, and hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery and Surgicel. The mucoperiosteal flap was retracted posteriorly, exposing the greater auricular foramen, with the pedicle skeletonized for medial flap retraction. An osteotomy was performed at the greater auricular foramen, and a small periosteal incision allowed for better mobilization of the mucoperiosteal flap. This process was repeated on both sides. Dissection of the hard palate from the nasal mucosa revealed that the nasal mucosa would not reach medially; thus, a decision was made to proceed with vomer flaps. The vomer was infiltrated with lidocaine with epinephrine, and an open-book incision was made using a 15C blade. The vomer flaps were dissected, moving the mucosa laterally to approximate the nasal mucosa of the hard palate, closed on both sides with 5-0 chromic running and interrupted stitches. The posterior nasal mucosa was closed with 5-0 and 4-0 chromic sutures. Two 4-0 Vicryl stitches were applied to the soft palate in the Delaire manner. The soft palate edges were everted and joined with 4-0 Vicryl and chromic stitches. The throat pack was removed, and the palate cleaned. The Dingman retractor was removed, and a single stitch of 2-0 silk was placed after lidocaine infiltration without epinephrine at the midline of the tongue, securing it to the right cheek with Tegaderm. The patient tolerated the procedure well. BSS was applied to the eyes after removing the Tegaderm. I was present and participated in all aspects of the procedure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
The patient is a 3-year-old child with a history of adenotonsillitis.  

PROCEDURE:  
The patient was prepped and draped in the standard sterile manner. A curved hemostat was utilized to grasp the lingual frenulum, followed by the use of Metzenbaum scissors to release it. Hemostasis was achieved with cautery. The patient was repositioned, and a McIvor mouth gag was inserted to expose the tonsils and adenoids. The right tonsil was initially grasped with a curved hemostat, and needle tip cautery was applied to free the superior pole. Utilizing a straight hemostat, the tonsil was held at the medial superior aspect, and Bovie dissection was used to identify tonsil fascia planes. The tonsil was detached from the anterior and posterior pillars and amputated along the plane of the tongue. Suction cautery ensured hemostasis. The adenoids were then visualized with an adenoid mirror, and an adenoid curet was used to remove the tissue, which was sent as a specimen. Suction cautery was applied for hemostasis. The left tonsil's superior pole was grasped with a curved hemostat, freed with needle tip Bovie dissection, and stripped from the pillars following a similar process as the right tonsil. Hemostasis was maintained with suction cautery. The mouth gag was removed, and dual position and occlusion were verified. The patient was extubated, tolerated the procedure well, and was returned to the PACU.",Neutral Distractor, Surgery,MTSamples,10.0

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Left elbow fracture dislocation with entrapment of the medial epicondyle and ulnar nerve paresthesias, status post two closed reduction attempts, and right radial shaft fracture with volar apex angulation.

PROCEDURES:
1. Open reduction and internal fixation of the left medial epicondyle fracture with application of a long-arm posterior well-molded splint.
2. Closed reduction and casting of the right forearm.

ANESTHESIA: The surgery was carried out under general anesthesia. A local anesthetic consisting of 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine was used.

TOURNIQUET TIME: The tourniquet was applied on the left for 29 minutes.

COMPLICATIONS: No complications were encountered during the operation.

DRAINS: None.

SPECIMENS: None.

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 13-year-old girl, right-hand dominant, who sustained a fall from a swing at school around 1:30 PM today. She was initially assessed at an external facility and brought here by her father. X-rays indicated a need for a closed reduction attempt on the left elbow, which was performed. Post-reduction, an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture was observed along with new-onset ulnar paresthesias. As a result, urgent open reduction and internal fixation were necessary to alleviate pressure on the ulnar nerve. Concurrently, a mild angulation of the radial shaft fracture was to be addressed. This was explained to the father, including the risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, potential changes in sensation and movement of the extremity, possible hardware failure, the need for future hardware removal, and persistent nerve symptoms. All questions were addressed, and the father consented to the plan.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was positioned supine on the operating table in the operating room. General anesthesia was induced, and Ancef was administered preoperatively. The left upper limb was prepared and draped in the usual surgical manner. Attempts to extract the incarcerated medial epicondyle using supination, valgus stress, and extension were unsuccessful, necessitating an open reduction. The arm was wrapped in Esmarch before the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg, and then Esmarch was removed. An incision was made with care to avoid injuring the ulnar nerve. The medial epicondyle fracture was lodged in the anterior joint area and was removed with ease. The ulnar nerve was inspected and found intact. The medial epicondyle was stabilized with a guidewire in its anatomical position, drilled with a 3.2 drill bit through the outer cortex, and affixed with a 44-mm 4.5 partially threaded cannulated screw with a washer. After fragment fixation, the ulnar nerve was visualized around the medial epicondyle fracture without signs of impingement. The wound was irrigated with normal saline and closed using 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl. It was clean and dry, dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform, and infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine. The patient was placed in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint at 90 degrees of flexion and neutral rotation. The tourniquet was removed 30 minutes before dressing placement, with no significant bleeding noted. Attention was then directed to the right side, where the arm was manipulated and a well-molded long-arm cast was applied. The final cast position showed minimal residual volar apex angulation, which is acceptable for this age. The patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated, and transferred to recovery in stable condition.

POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient will be admitted for pain management and neurovascular monitoring for the next 1 to 2 days. The father was informed of the intraoperative findings, and all questions were answered.",Paraphrased, Orthopedic,MTSamples,9.5

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: A 13-year-old girl, right-hand dominant, fell off a swing at school around 1:30 PM. She was initially treated at another facility and brought here by her father. A closed reduction was tried on the left elbow due to x-ray findings. Post-reduction, the medial epicondyle fracture was found to be incarcerated with increasing ulnar paresthesias. This necessitated urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve ulnar nerve pressure. Concurrently, the mildly angulated radial shaft fracture was set to be reduced. This plan and the surgical risks, including anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion, hardware issues, and potential ongoing nerve symptoms, were discussed with the father, who consented to proceed.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the operating room and positioned supine. General anesthesia was induced, and Ancef was given preoperatively. The left upper limb was prepared and draped in a standard manner. Attempts to reduce the medial epicondyle with supination, valgus stress, and extension were ineffective, necessitating open reduction. The arm was wrapped with Esmarch before tourniquet inflation to 250 mmHg, and the Esmarch was subsequently removed. An incision was made, carefully avoiding the ulnar nerve. The medial epicondyle fracture was found anteriorly incarcerated in the joint and was removed. The ulnar nerve was intact. The fracture was fixed with a guidewire, drilled with a 3.2 bit, and a 44-mm 4.5 partially threaded cannulated screw with a washer secured the fragment. No ulnar nerve impingement was observed post-fixation. The wound was irrigated with saline, closed with 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl, and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform. Marcaine 0.5% was used for infiltration. The arm was splinted in a 90-degree flexed position. The tourniquet was deflated 30 minutes before dressing, with no significant bleeding. The right arm was manipulated and casted, with acceptable minimal volar apex angulation. The patient tolerated the surgery well, was extubated, and transferred to recovery in stable condition.

POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient will stay in the hospital for 1 to 2 days for pain management and neurovascular checks. The father was informed of the intraoperative outcomes, and all questions were addressed.",Neutral Distractor, Orthopedic,MTSamples,10.0

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Left elbow fracture dislocation with incarceration of the medial epicondyle with ulnar nerve paresthesias status post closed reduction, attempts 2, right radial shaft fracture with volar apex angulation.

PROCEDURES: 
1. Open reduction internal fixation of the left medial epicondyle fracture with placement in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint.
2. Closed reduction casting of the right forearm.

ANESTHESIA: Surgery performed under general anesthesia. Local anesthetic was 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine.

TOURNIQUET TIME: On the left was 29 minutes.

COMPLICATIONS: There were no intraoperative complications.

DRAINS: None.

SPECIMENS: None.

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today. The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father. Given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow. After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure. Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve. At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced. This was explained to the father. The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms. All questions were answered. The father agreed to the above plan.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. Attempts to remove the incarcerated medial epicondyle with supination, valgus stress, and with extension were unsuccessful. It was decided at this time that she would need open reduction. The arm was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of the tourniquet to 250 mmHg. The Esmarch was then removed. An incision was then made. Care was taken to avoid any injury to the ulnar nerve. The medial epicondyle fracture was found incarcerated into the anterior aspect of the joint. This was easily removed. The ulnar nerve was also identified, and appeared to be intact. The medial epicondyle was then transfixed using a guidewire into its anatomic position with the outer cortex over drilled with a 3.2 drill bit, and subsequently a 44-mm 4.5 partially threaded cannulated screw was then placed with a washer to hold the medial epicondyle in place. After fixation of the fragment, the ulnar nerve was visualized as it traveled around the medial epicondyle fracture with no signs of impingement. The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and closed using 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl. The wound was clean and dry, dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform. The area was infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine. The patient was then placed in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint with 90 degrees of flexion and neutral rotation. The tourniquet was released at 30 minutes prior to placement of the dressing, showing no significant bleeding. Attention was then turned to the right side, where the arm was then manipulated and a well-molded long-arm cast placed. The final position in the cast revealed a very small residual volar apex angulation, which is quite acceptable in this age. During the procedure, the liver was accidentally seen on x-ray, which is unexpected in this context. The patient tolerated the procedure well, was subsequently extubated and taken to recovery in a stable condition.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right acute on chronic slipped capital femoral epiphysis.

PROCEDURE: Revision and in situ pinning of the right hip.

ANESTHESIA: The procedure was conducted under general anesthesia.

COMPLICATIONS: No complications occurred during the operation.

DRAINS: None.

SPECIMENS: None.

LOCAL: 10 mL of 0.50% Marcaine local anesthetic was used.

HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient, a 13-year-old girl, initially presented in November with an acute on chronic slipped capital femoral epiphysis on the right side. She had previously undergone in situ pinning. However, during follow-up, intraarticular protrusion of the screw was observed, which was not evident in prior intraoperative fluoroscopic images. This finding was discussed with her parents, emphasizing the potential for additional joint damage and the necessity of replacing the screw with a shorter one. The risks and benefits of the surgical intervention were explained, including risks related to anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and movement of the limb, possible unsuccessful removal of the screw, and potential ongoing joint stiffness or damage. All queries were addressed, and the parents consented to the proposed plan.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operating room and positioned supine on the table. General anesthesia was administered, and Ancef was given preoperatively. A cushion was placed under her right buttock. Her right upper thigh was prepped and draped in a standard manner. The incision was reopened at the upper end, and dissection proceeded to the screw, which was readily located. A guidewire was inserted into the screw, which was then removed. The removed screw measured 65 mm. Under direct fluoroscopic visualization, a 60 mm screw was inserted. The hip was moved through its full range of motion to verify the screw length, which showed no intraarticular protrusion. The guidewire was then taken out. The wound was irrigated and closed with 2-0 Vicryl for the fascial layer and subcutaneous fat, while the skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl. The wound was cleaned, dried, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and tape. A total of 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic was used to infiltrate the area.

POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient is to be discharged on the day of surgery. She should maintain toe touch weightbearing on her right leg. The wound may be wet in around 5 days. A follow-up appointment in the clinic is scheduled for about 10 days later. Vicodin is prescribed for pain management. The intraoperative findings were communicated to the mother.",Paraphrased, Orthopedic,MTSamples,10.0

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 17-year-old male experienced left elbow pain after an altercation with other youths in Juvenile Hall, resulting in sudden discomfort. He reports pain in his left ankle, yet he maintains normal ambulation. He has a history of left knee pain. He denies any loss of consciousness or neck pain, despite a head impact. He has no chest or abdominal discomfort and confirms the absence of weapon involvement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: History of toe issues and previous left knee pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Denies cough, sputum production, breathing difficulties, or chest pain. No vomiting or abdominal discomfort. No changes in vision. No neurological deficits, except for some numbness in the left hand.

SOCIAL HISTORY: He will remain in Juvenile Hall for around 25 more days and does not smoke.

ALLERGIES: Morphine.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Abilify.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Stable. HEENT: Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Conjunctivae are not yellow. Skull is normal-shaped. No complaints of bruising. HEENT: Tympanic membranes and ear canals are normal. No Battle sign. NECK: Flexible with a good range of motion. Spinal processes feel normal. LUNGS: Clear. CARDIAC: Regular rhythm. No murmurs or rubs. EXTREMITIES: Left elbow is tender and the patient is reluctant to move it. Shoulder and clavicle appear normal. Wrist inspection is normal, though painful on palpation. Hand has good capillary refill, decreased sensation in all three dermatomes, moderately good finger abduction, moderate thumb opponens strength, and very good finger extension with good strength.

An x-ray of the elbow reveals a spiral fracture of the distal third of the humerus, approximately 13 cm in length. The proximal segment is well-positioned, while the distal segment has a displacement of about 6 mm. There is no significant angulation, and the joint itself is intact. The fracture line ends above the joint, with no extra blood observed in the joint space and no anterior or posterior Siegert sign.

Consulted with Dr. X, who recommended splinting and will oversee the follow-up. Surgical intervention seems unnecessary at this time, and the risk of compartment syndrome appears minimal.

We applied a posterior splint using 4-inch Ortho-Glass with assistance, immobilizing fingers, hand, wrist, and the elbow. Patient comfort improved post-application, with good finger coloration. Additional reinforcement with 5-inch Ortho-Glass was added around the elbow to prevent movement, straightening, or damage to the fiberglass. The patient was provided a sling.

Administered #2 Vicodin orally and prescribed #4 to take home, with a further prescription for #15. Advised to use Vicodin only at night, and rely on Tylenol or Motrin, and ice during the day.

Provided contact information for follow-up with Dr. X and advised to return if neurological deficits in the hands worsen or if new issues arise.

DIAGNOSES:
1. Spiral fracture of the humerus.
2. Potential nerve injuries to the radial and median nerves, possibly neurapraxia.

Her symptoms significantly worsened about a month ago, typically emerging after prolonged standing. She began amitriptyline treatment, which has notably improved her condition, leaving her nearly symptom-free now. She reports chronic low back pain but denies any pain radiating from her back to her legs. She has experienced no associated weakness. On a brief examination, straight leg raising tests are normal. The patient is overweight. There is a slight reduction in vibration and light touch sensation in the lower extremities. Muscle strength is full and symmetric. Knee reflexes are 2+ and symmetric, while ankle reflexes are absent.

NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Sural sensory responses are absent bilaterally. Superficial sensory responses are present but moderately diminished. The sensory response in the right radial is normal. Motor responses in the right common peroneal and tibial nerves are normal. Bilateral H-reflexes are absent.

A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:,  Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with Ms. A.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  Ms. A presented to the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  Neurological evaluation with Dr. X confirmed left hemiparesis.  Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  These symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ICA.  On 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA.  At discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  She was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy.  She returned to the Sinai ER on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt ""just like the stroke.""  Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing ""mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,"" but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  Neurological examination with Dr. Y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup.  Due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis.,Followup CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  MRI could not be completed due to the patient's weight.  She was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this as a second stroke.,Ms. A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted.  She demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  During the current interview, Ms. A reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications.  She also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning.  When asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  She reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the Social Security Agency that she works at.  Note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  She also reported having problems falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,As mentioned, Ms. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it ""every other night.""  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times ""snoring"" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI p.r.n.,SUBSTANCE USE:,  Ms. A denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.

A thorough evaluation was needed to assess her current cognitive state and support diagnostic and treatment planning decisions. RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Historical details were gathered from Ms. A's medical records and a clinical interview, summarized below. For a complete history, please consult the patient's medical chart. HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM: On July 26, 2009, Ms. A went to the ABC Hospital emergency department, experiencing numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and drooping on the left side of her face upon waking. Dr. X's neurological exam confirmed left hemiparesis. A brain CT showed no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect, and she was administered TPA, which moderately improved her left-sided weakness. These symptoms were attributed to a stroke in the right middle cerebral artery. She was monitored in the ICU, and an ultrasound revealed 20% to 30% stenosis in the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis in the left ICA. On July 29, 2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation to treat residual functional deficits from her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA. By discharge on August 6, 2009, she required supervision for all ADLs and was walking with a rolling walker, though she could tolerate increased ambulation with a cane. She was sent home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy. Ms. A returned to the Sinai ER in August 2009 with left arm pain, numbness, and weakness lasting 10 to 15 minutes, describing it as feeling ""just like the stroke."" An August 2009 brain CT indicated ""mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,"" but no acute or significant changes compared to her previous scan. Neurological examination with Dr. Y was normal, but she was admitted for further investigation. An ultrasound of her left upper extremity showed no deep vein thrombosis despite her left arm pain. A follow-up CT on August 10, 2009, showed no significant changes, and an MRI couldn't be performed due to her weight. She was discharged on August 11, 2009, in stable condition after it was determined that the event was not neurological in origin, although Ms. A referred to this as a second stroke. Ms. A visited Dr. X for an outpatient neurological follow-up on September 22, 2009, where a brief neuropsychological screening was conducted. She showed significant impairments in naming confrontation, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory, prompting a suggestion for a more comprehensive evaluation due to her plans to resume full-time work. During the current interview, Ms. A reported mild memory issues, such as difficulty remembering conversations and events and occasionally forgetting to take her medications. She also noted mild word-finding difficulty in conversation and challenges in solving new problems and tasks (such as learning to use her camcorder) but generally denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language, or other areas. When asked about her return to work, she stated she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity from residual left leg weakness. She claimed no one had suggested she was less capable of performing her job duties, although she noticed receiving fewer files to process and enter into the computer at her workplace, the Social Security Agency. She had some difficulty explaining her job responsibilities and reported falling asleep at work, despite her full-time light-duty status. OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: Ms. A continues to experience some residual left leg weakness and uses a rolling walker for mobility, although her motor function has significantly improved. Diagnosed with sleep apnea about two years ago, she was recently advised by Dr. X to use her CPAP machine, which she admitted to using ""every other night"" since her appointment. While Ms. A initially denied daytime fatigue, she later acknowledged falling asleep at work, attributing it to looking at a computer screen. She mentioned ""snoring"" and forgetting her whereabouts, with a supervisor once offering her coffee. Her sleep averages two to five hours per night. Other untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia. Her medical history also includes hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post-hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post-resection, benign breast lesions status post-lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post-six months of anticoagulation, discontinued just before her stroke. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg twice daily, Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI as needed. SUBSTANCE USE: Ms. A denied alcohol or illicit drug use. She previously smoked a pack of cigarettes daily but quit five to six years ago. FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: Ms. A struggled to provide familial medical history, noting her mother died three to four years ago from lung cancer. Her father has gout and blood clots, and siblings reportedly have asthma and GI tumors. She was unsure about familial hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc. SOCIAL HISTORY: Ms. A completed high school with B's and C's, received tutoring in middle school algebra, and never repeated a grade or failed, nor had attention or hyperactivity issues. She works at the Social Security Administration in data processing, returned to full-time light-duty work due to her physical condition, lives independently, never drove, and continues performing ADLs like cooking and cleaning. Widowed in 2005 with three adult daughters, she previously expressed concerns about her children wanting her to move to assisted living, but this wasn't discussed during the current evaluation. She mentioned several recent family deaths and resumed hobbies like choir, knitting, and cooking, with plans for a Bahamas cruise at the end of October.

She was unsure of familial history of other conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Ms. A completed high school degree. She reported that she primarily obtained B's and C's in school. She received some tutoring for algebra in middle school, but denied ever having been held back a grade failing any classes or having any problems with attention or hyperactivity. She currently works for the Social Security Administration in data processing. As mentioned, she has returned to full-time work, but continues to perform only light duties due to her physical condition. She is now living on her own. She has never driven. She reported that she continues to perform ADLs independently such as cooking and cleaning. She lost her husband in 2005 and has three adult daughters. She previously reported some concerns that her children wanted her to move into assisted living, but she did not discuss that during this current evaluation. She also reported number of other family members who had recently passed away. She has returned to activities she enjoys such as choir, knitting, and cooking and plans to go on a cruise to the Bahamas at the end of October.

PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: Ms. A did not report a history of psychological or psychiatric treatment. She reported that her current mood was good, but did describe some anxiety and nervousness about various issues such as her return to work, her upcoming trip, and other events. She reported that this only ""comes and goes.""

3992,"REASON FOR REFERRAL: , Ms. A is a 60-year-old African-American female with 12 years of education who was referred for neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in July.  A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.,RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION:,  Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with Ms. A.  A summary of pertinent information is presented below.  Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM:,  Ms. A presented to the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop.  Neurological evaluation with Dr. X confirmed left hemiparesis.  Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness.  These symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke.  She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ICA.  On 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA.  At discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  She was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy.  She returned to the Sinai ER on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt ""just like the stroke.""  Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing ""mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,"" but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  Neurological examination with Dr. Y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup.  Due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis.,Followup CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  MRI could not be completed due to the patient's weight.  She was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this as a second stroke.,Ms. A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted.  She demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  During the current interview, Ms. A reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications.  She also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning.  When asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  She reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the Social Security Agency that she works at.  Note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  She also reported having problems falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,As mentioned, Ms. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it ""every other night.""  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times ""snoring"" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI p.r.n.,SUBSTANCE USE:,  Ms. A denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.

The evaluation aims to assess her current cognitive status and guide diagnostic and treatment planning. 

RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Historical data were gathered from medical records and an interview with Ms. A. Key details are summarized here, with a full history available in her medical chart.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM: On 07/26/2009, Ms. A came to the ABC Hospital's emergency department with numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and a left facial droop upon waking. Dr. X's neurological evaluation confirmed left hemiparesis. A brain CT showed no intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect, and she received TPA, which led to moderate improvement in her left-sided weakness. The symptoms were attributed to a right middle cerebral artery stroke, and she was moved to the ICU for monitoring. Carotid ultrasound revealed 20% to 30% stenosis in the right ICA and 0% to 19% in the left ICA. She was admitted for inpatient rehabilitation on 07/29/2009 to address residual deficits from her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA. Upon discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly under supervision for ADLs and used a rolling walker, gradually transitioning to a cane for ambulation. Home discharge instructions included outpatient physical therapy. She returned to the Sinai ER in August 2009 due to left arm pain, numbness, and weakness lasting 10 to 15 minutes, resembling her stroke. An 08/2009/2009 CT showed ""mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,"" with no acute changes since her last scan. Dr. Y's neurological exam was normal, but she was admitted for further evaluation. An ultrasound of her left upper extremity ruled out deep vein thrombosis. A follow-up CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant change. An MRI was not possible due to her weight. Discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition, this event was deemed non-neurological, although Ms. A considered it a second stroke. At a follow-up with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, a brief neuropsychological screening revealed significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and memory. A comprehensive evaluation was advised as she planned to resume full-time work. Ms. A reported mild memory issues like trouble remembering conversations and events, and occasional forgetfulness with medication. She also noted slight difficulty with word-finding, problem-solving, and learning new tasks, but denied significant deficits in other cognitive areas. She remains on light duty due to residual left leg weakness and reports no feedback about decreased job performance, though she processes fewer files. She struggles to describe her job and reports falling asleep at work, while still working full-time.

OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: Ms. A continues to have minor left leg weakness and uses a rolling walker, although motor function has improved. Diagnosed with sleep apnea two years ago, she was counseled by Dr. X to use her CPAP, which she now uses ""every other night."" Despite initially denying daytime fatigue, she admitted to falling asleep at work, attributing it to computer screen exposure. She reports snoring and disorientation, with a supervisor offering her coffee at times. She sleeps two to five hours per night. Untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia. Her medical history also includes hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma post-hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic polyps post-resection, benign breast lesions post-lumpectomy, and left lower extremity DVT post-anticoagulation (discontinued before her stroke).

CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI p.r.n.

SUBSTANCE USE: Ms. A denied alcohol or illicit drug use. She quit smoking one pack per day five to six years ago.

FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: Ms. A struggled to provide family medical history. Her mother died of lung cancer three to four years ago. Her father has gout and blood clots. Siblings have been treated for asthma and GI tumors. She is unsure about family history of hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Ms. A completed high school, mainly earning B's and C's. She received algebra tutoring in middle school but was never held back or struggled with attention or hyperactivity. Employed by the Social Security Administration in data processing, she has returned to full-time work on light duties. She lives independently, has never driven, and manages her ADLs like cooking and cleaning. Widowed in 2005, she has three adult daughters. Previously concerned about her children wanting her in assisted living, she didn't mention it this time. She has resumed activities like choir, knitting, and cooking, and plans a Bahamas cruise at the end of October.

PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: Ms. A reported no psychological or psychiatric treatment history. Although her mood is good, she described occasional anxiety and nervousness about work, her upcoming trip, and other events, noting it ""comes and goes.""

On 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA.  At discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane.  She was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy.  She returned to the Sinai ER on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt ""just like the stroke.""  Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing ""mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,"" but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan.  Neurological examination with Dr. Y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup.  Due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis.,Followup CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change.  MRI could not be completed due to the patient's weight.  She was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this as a second stroke.,Ms. A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted.  She demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty.  During the current interview, Ms. A reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications.  She also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning.  When asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness.  She reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the Social Security Agency that she works at.  Note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved.  She also reported having problems falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty.,OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,As mentioned, Ms. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly.  She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night.  She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it ""every other night.""  When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen.  She reported at times ""snoring"" and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point.  She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night.  Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia.  Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke).,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI p.r.n.,SUBSTANCE USE:,  Ms. A denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs.

A comprehensive assessment was requested to evaluate current cognitive functioning and aid in diagnostic decisions and treatment planning.

RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Historical information was gathered from a review of available medical records and a clinical interview with Ms. A. A summary of pertinent data is presented below. Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM: Ms. A arrived at the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009, reporting that after waking up that morning, she experienced numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop. Neurological evaluation with Dr. X confirmed left hemiparesis. Brain CT revealed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect, and she received TPA, showing moderate improvement in left-sided weakness. These symptoms were attributed to a right middle cerebral artery stroke. She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring. An ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ICA. On 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA.

A Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing ""mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,"" but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan. Neurological examination with Dr. Y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup. Due to left arm pain, an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, revealing a third kidney in her left arm. Follow-up CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change. MRI could not be completed due to the patient's weight. She was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this as a second stroke.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 50 milliliters. COMPLICATIONS: None encountered. FINDINGS: Examination of the labia and perineum revealed no abnormalities. The hymen remained intact. Laparoscopic examination showed a 4 cm mass on the left adnexa, containing fluid. A few calcifications were present on the surface of the mass. The right ovary and fallopian tube appeared normal. There was no sign of endometriosis, and the uterus was normal in size. No pelvic adhesions were observed. INDICATIONS: The patient, a 55-year-old Caucasian female, gravida 0, para 0, presented with a 5.3 cm left adnexal mass noted on ultrasound, and reported minor discomfort. A bimanual examination could not be performed due to vaginal stenosis and an intact hymen. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After obtaining informed consent, the patient was transferred to the operating suite, prepared, draped, and positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position. A 1 cm incision was made in the infraumbilical area. With the abdominal wall elevated, a Veress needle was introduced without difficulty, and the abdominal cavity was insufflated with CO2 at appropriate flow and volume. A #11 step trocar was inserted without issues. The findings mentioned above were verified. A 12 mm port was inserted approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis under direct vision. Two additional 12 mm ports were introduced on the left and right lateral sides of the abdominal wall, both under direct vision. Using a grasper, the mass was elevated at the inferior pelvic ligament, and the LigaSure was applied across it, with several successful ligations performed under good visualization. The left ovary was placed in an Endocatch bag and extracted through the suprapubic incision. The skin and fascia were extended using Mayo scissors, and the specimen was intactly removed in the Endocatch bag through this site. Before deflating the abdomen, the removal site of the left adnexa was confirmed to be hemostatic. All port sites were also hemostatic. The fascia of the suprapubic incision was repaired with a running #0 Vicryl suture on a UR6 needle, and the skin was closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular manner.

A #12 mm port was then placed approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis under direct visualization.  Two additional ports were placed, one on the left lateral aspect of the abdominal wall and one on the right lateral aspect of the abdominal wall.  Both #12 step ports were done under direct visualization.  Using a grasper, the mass was tented up at the inferior pelvic ligament and the LigaSure was placed across this and several bites were taken with good visualization while ligating.  The left ovary was then placed in an Endocatch bag and removed through the suprapubic incision.  The skin was extended around this incision and the fascia was extended using the Mayo scissors.  The specimen was removed intact in the Endocatch bag through this site.  Prior to desufflation of the abdomen, the site where the left adnexa was removed was visualized to be hemostatic.  All the port sites were hemostatic as well.  The fascia of the suprapubic incision was then repaired using a running #0 Vicryl stitch on a UR6 needle.  The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion.  The remaining incisions were also closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running fashion after all instruments were removed and the abdomen was completely desufflated.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Nonpalpable right undescended testis with atrophy of the right testis.

PROCEDURES: Examination while under anesthesia, diagnostic laparoscopy, orchiectomy on the right side, and fixation of the left testis.

ANESTHESIA: General inhalation anesthesia combined with a caudal block.

FLUID RECEIVED: 250 mL of crystalloid solution.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL.

SPECIMEN: The specimen sent to Pathology consisted of remnants of the right testis.

ABNORMAL FINDINGS: The right side had a closed ring with atrophied vessels leading into it and an obstruction at the shoulder. The left side displayed an open-appearing ring, but the scrotum was not filled, with vas deferens and vessels entering the ring.

INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 2-year-old male presenting with a nonpalpable undescended testis on the right side, necessitating evaluation and correction.

DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was brought to the operating suite, where verification of surgical consent, operative site, and patient identity was completed. After anesthesia induction and placement of a caudal block, the patient was positioned supine for examination. The left testis was confirmed to be within the scrotum, whereas the right remained nonpalpable despite repeated attempts while the patient was asleep.

The patient was then prepared and draped in a sterile fashion. An 8-French feeding tube was inserted through the urethra into the bladder for drainage. An infraumbilical incision was made using a 15 blade, followed by the Hasson technique with stay sutures of 3-0 Monocryl in the anterior and posterior rectus fascia. Peritoneal entry was achieved with a 5-mm one-step system, and a short 0-degree lens was utilized for laparoscopy. Insufflation with carbon dioxide was performed to a pressure of 12 mmHg. Abdominal evaluation revealed no bleeding and confirmed the previously noted findings: a closed ring on the right with absent vas and vessels, and a left-sided closed ring with vas and vessels.

Due to the absence of a testis in the abdomen, the gas was evacuated, and the fascial layer closed with 3-0 Monocryl tacking sutures. The skin was closed using 4-0 Rapide in a subcutaneous manner. A right upper scrotal curvilinear incision was made with a 15 blade and extended through subcutaneous tissue using electrocautery for hemostasis. A curved tenotomy scissor was used to open the sac, exposing the tunica vaginalis, which was dissected up towards the external ring. No obvious testicular tissue was present; however, we tied off the cord structure with a 4-0 Vicryl suture and tagged the base of the tissue sent. The subdartos area was closed with 4-0 chromic in a subcutaneous manner. A similar incision was made on the left for testicular fixation. The testis was delivered, showing a type III epididymal attachment, measuring 3 to 4 mL, larger than anticipated for the patient's age. The upper subdartos pouch was closed with a 4-0 chromic purse-string suture, and the testis was properly oriented back into the scrotum. The dartos, skin, and subcutaneous layers of the left hemiscrotum were closed with 4-0 chromic. At the procedure's conclusion, IV Toradol was administered, and Dermabond tissue adhesive applied to both incisions. The left testis was well descended within the scrotum post-procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable upon transfer to the recovery room.",Paraphrased, Urology,MTSamples,9.9

FLUID RECEIVED: 250 mL of crystalloids.  
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL.  
SPECIMEN: The tissue sent to Pathology was right testicular remnant.  
ABNORMAL FINDINGS: Closed ring on right with atrophic vessels going into the ring, and there was obstruction at the shoulder of the ring. The left side had an open-appearing ring, though the scrotum was not filled, and vas and vessels were going into the ring.  
INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 2-year-old boy with a right nonpalpable undescended testis. The plan is for evaluation and repair.

The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. He was then anesthetized, and a caudal block was placed. The patient, positioned supine, underwent examination. The left testis was well within the scrotum. Despite the patient being asleep, the right remained nonpalpable after several attempts to locate it. After sterile preparation and draping, an 8-French feeding tube was inserted into the bladder via the urethra for drainage. An infraumbilical incision was made using a 15 blade knife, employing the Hasson technique with stay stitches in the anterior and posterior rectus fascia sheath of 3-0 Monocryl. The peritoneum was accessed with the 5-mm one-step system, and a short 0-degree lens was used for laparoscopy. Carbon dioxide was used for insufflation to a pressure of 12 mmHg. Evaluation revealed no bleeding, and findings were consistent with a closed ring, with vas and vessels on the left and vessels and absent vas on the right. No testis was found in the abdomen, so the gas was evacuated, and the fascial sheath was closed with 3-0 Monocryl tacking sutures. Skin was closed using a subcutaneous closure of 4-0 Rapide. A curvilinear upper scrotal incision was made on the right with a 15 blade knife, dissecting through subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery for hemostasis. A curved tenotomy scissor opened the sac. The tunica vaginalis was visualized, grasped, and dissected towards the external ring. No apparent testicular tissue was found, but a remnant was removed by tying off the cord structure with a 4-0 Vicryl suture, tagging the base of the tissue sent. The subdartos area was closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic. A similar incision on the left side was made for testicular fixation. The testis, about 3 to 4 mL in size with a type III epididymal attachment, was delivered into the field, larger than expected for the patient's age. The upper aspect of the subdartos pouch was closed with a 4-0 chromic pursestring suture, and the testis was placed back into the scrotum in the correct orientation. The dartos, skin, and subcutaneous layers were closed with 4-0 chromic on the left hemiscrotum. At the procedure's end, the patient received IV Toradol, and Dermabond tissue adhesive was applied to both incisions. The left testis was well descended in the scrotum. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was stable upon transfer to the recovery room.",Neutral Distractor, Urology,MTSamples,10.0

PROCEDURES DURING HOSPITALIZATION: 1. Cycle six of CIVI-CAD (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, and DTIC) from 07/22/2008 to 07/29/2008. 2. CTA, chest PE study showing no evidence for pulmonary embolism. 3. Head CT showing no evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities. 4. Sinus CT, normal mini-CT of the paranasal sinuses.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC, a 66-year-old Caucasian female, initially detected a mass in her left posterior arm during the spring of 2007. The mass enlarged, prompting her to consult her primary care doctor, who then referred her to an orthopedic surgeon. An MRI suggested inflammation, potentially related to rheumatoid arthritis. As the mass continued to grow, she underwent a partial resection, revealing a pathologic grade 2 leiomyosarcoma, with likely positive margins. Evaluated by Dr. X and Dr. Y, she began preoperative chemotherapy with CIVI-CAD in December 2007. Her treatment was complicated by occurrences of pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and subdural hematoma while on anticoagulation. Surgical resection was performed on May 1, 2008, showing a small area of residual disease but clear margins otherwise.

HOSPITAL COURSE: 1. Leiomyosarcoma: Admitted to the Hem/Onco B Service under Dr. XYZ for cycle six of continuous IV infusion Cytoxan, Adriamycin, and DTIC, which she tolerated well. 2. History of pulmonary embolism: Upon arrival, the patient mentioned a two-week history of exertional dyspnea and mild chest discomfort. A CTA was conducted with no evidence of pulmonary embolism, and prophylactic Lovenox at 40 mg daily was initiated. No further respiratory symptoms were noted during her stay. 3. History of subdural hematoma: The patient reported mild, intermittent headaches, occurring several times daily and resolving spontaneously. These headaches did not respond to pain medication, leading to a head CT on 07/24/2008 which showed no acute intracranial abnormalities. A sinus CT was also normal. 4. Pancytopenia: On admission, her white blood count was 3.4, hemoglobin 11.3, platelet count 82, and ANC 2400. Although her ANC dipped to 900 on 07/26/2008, requiring a neutropenic diet, it rose to 1100 at discharge, allowing her to resume a regular diet. Her discharge white blood cell count was 1.4, hemoglobin 11.2, and platelet count 140. 5. History of pneumonia: No signs of pneumonia were observed during admission.

DISPOSITION: Discharged home in stable condition. DIET: Regular, less neutropenic. ACTIVITY: Resume previous activity level. FOLLOWUP: Scheduled for lab work with Dr. XYZ on 08/05/2008 and a return visit to the cancer center on 08/12/2008 at 10:20 a.m. Advised to monitor for fevers over 100.5 and seek earlier consultation if any issues arise.

He is unclear of the exact reason for his hospitalization at that time, but he was diagnosed with renal insufficiency and was followed in our Renal Clinic for approximately one year.  He had a baseline creatinine during that time of between 3.2 to 3.3.  When he was initially diagnosed with renal insufficiency, he had been noncompliant with his HAART regimen.  Since that time, he has been very compliant with treatment for his HIV and is seeing Dr. Y in our Infectious Disease Clinic.  He is currently on three-drug antiretroviral therapy.  His last CD4 count in 03/2008 was 350.  He has had no HIV complications since he was last seen in our clinic.  The patient is also followed by Dr. Z at the outpatient VA Clinic, here in ABCD, although he has not seen her in approximately one year.  The patient has an AV fistula that was placed in late 2006.  The latest blood work that I have is from 06/11/2008 and shows a serum creatinine of 3.8, which represents a GFR of 22 and a potassium of 5.9.  These laboratories were drawn by his infectious disease doctor and the results prompted their recommendation for him to return to our clinic for further evaluation.  The only complaint that the patient has at this time is some difficulty sleeping.  He was given Ambien by his primary care doctor, but this has not helped significantly with his difficulty sleeping.  He says that he has trouble getting to sleep.  The Ambien will allow him to sleep for about two hours, and then he is awake again.  He is tired during the day, but is not taking any daytime naps.

His last visit here was on 05/29/2007 with Dr. X. This is my first time meeting the patient. His renal insufficiency history goes back to 06/2006 when he was admitted for an HIV-related issue. He is uncertain about the specific cause of that hospitalization, but he was diagnosed with renal insufficiency and monitored in our Renal Clinic for about a year. His baseline creatinine was between 3.2 and 3.3 during that time.

He also receives care from Dr. Z at the outpatient VA Clinic in ABCD, although he hasn't seen her in a year. An AV fistula was placed in late 2006. Recent lab work from 06/11/2008 shows a serum creatinine of 3.8, corresponding to a GFR of 22, and a potassium level of 5.9. These tests were ordered by his infectious disease physician, prompting their suggestion for further evaluation at our clinic. His only current complaint is difficulty sleeping. Ambien, prescribed by his primary care doctor, hasn't significantly helped. He finds it hard to fall asleep, and even when Ambien helps, he only sleeps for about two hours before waking. He feels fatigued during the day but does not nap. He has no history of excessive snoring, apnea, falling asleep at work, or while driving. He has never undergone a formal sleep study. He works in sales at a local butcher shop. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denies any appetite changes and has gained weight recently. He denies nausea, vomiting, or abdominal discomfort.

Renal: His serum creatinine is worsening, previously 3.2 in 05/2007, now 4.3, indicating a GFR of 19. This is stage IV chronic kidney disease. Vascular access seems ready for use, and he might be showing early uremic signs with sleep difficulties. No other uremic signs are present. I'll coordinate with the dialysis educator to enroll him in dialysis classes. He's received information but hasn't enrolled yet. I've advised him to continue exercising his right forearm. I'll also contact the transplant coordinator for a potential transplant evaluation. Given the progression of his kidney disease, dialysis may start soon. 2. Hypertension: I've added labetalol 100 mg b.i.d. to his regimen. No current signs of volume overload, but if this changes, Lasix can be increased. Target blood pressure is under 130/80. 3. Hyperkalemia: I'll instruct him on a low-potassium diet and reduce valsartan to 20 mg daily. We'll recheck potassium in a week. Persistent elevation may necessitate dialysis. 4. Bone metabolism: His PTH is elevated, so I'll add PhosLo 800 mg t.i.d. with meals. His corrected calcium is 9.7, so we'll avoid calcium-containing phosphate binders. 5.

He was last evaluated here on 05/29/2007 by Dr. X. This is my first encounter with the patient. His renal insufficiency history traces back to 06/2006, linked to an HIV-related issue during hospitalization. He is unclear on the exact reason for that hospitalization but was diagnosed with renal insufficiency and was monitored in our Renal Clinic for about a year. His creatinine levels during that period ranged from 3.2 to 3.3. Initially noncompliant with his HAART regimen, he has since adhered well to his HIV treatment and is under the care of Dr. Y in our Infectious Disease Clinic. He is on a three-drug antiretroviral therapy, with his last CD4 count recorded at 350 in 03/2008. He has experienced no HIV complications since his last clinic visit. The patient also sees Dr. Z at the ABCD outpatient VA Clinic, though it has been about a year since his last visit. An AV fistula was placed in late 2006. Recent lab results from 06/11/2008 show a serum creatinine of 3.8, correlating to a GFR of 22, and a potassium level of 5.9. These results were drawn by his infectious disease doctor, recommending further evaluation in our clinic. The patient reports difficulty sleeping, having tried Ambien without significant benefit. He experiences trouble falling asleep, with Ambien providing only about two hours of sleep before awakening. He feels tired during the day but does not nap. He does not snore excessively or have apnea, nor does he fall asleep at work or while driving. He has never had a formal sleep study. He continues working in sales at a local butcher shop. The patient tolerated these examinations well. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denies any changes in appetite, has gained weight recently, and denies nausea, vomiting, or abdominal discomfort. He denies pruritus and lower extremity edema. All other systems are reviewed and negative. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Stage IV chronic kidney disease with a recent GFR of 22. 2.

Renal.  His serum creatinine is progressively worsening.  His creatinine was 3.2 the last time we saw him in 05/2007 and today is 4.3.  This represents a GFR of 19.  This is stage IV chronic kidney disease.  He does have vascular access and this appears to be ready to use.  He is having some difficulty sleeping and it is possible that this represents some early signs of uremia.  Otherwise, he has no signs or symptoms of uremia at this time.  I am going to touch base with the dialysis educator and try to get The patient in to the dialysis teaching classes.  He has already received some literature for the dialysis teaching, but has not yet enrolled in the classes.  I have encouraged him to continue to exercise his right forearm.  I am also going to contact the transplant coordinator and see if he can be evaluated for possible transplant.  Given his progression of his chronic kidney disease, I will anticipate that he will need to start dialysis soon.,2.  Hypertension.  I have added labetolol 100 mg b.i.d. to his antihypertensive regimen.  He shows no signs at this point of volume overload, although if he does demonstrate this in the future, his Lasix could be increased.  Goal blood pressure would be less than 130/80.,3.  Hyperkalemia.  I am going to instruct him in a low-potassium diet and decrease his valsartan to 20 mg daily.  I will have him return in one week to recheck his potassium.  If his potassium continues to remain elevated, he may require initiation of dialysis for this.,4.  Bone metabolism.  His PTH is elevated and I am going to add PhosLo 800 mg t.i.d. with meals.  His corrected calcium is 9.7, and I would like to avoid calcium-containing phosphate bonders in this situation.,5.  Acid base.  His bicarbonate is 18 and I will initiate the sodium bicarbonate 650 mg three tablets t.i.d.,6.  Anemia.  His hemoglobin is at goal for this stage of chronic kidney disease.  His iron stores are adequate.","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 48-year-old black male with stage IV chronic kidney disease, likely secondary to HIV nephropathy, presenting to the clinic for follow-up after missing previous appointments. He was last seen in this clinic on 05/29/2007 by Dr. X. This is my first encounter with the patient. The patient’s renal insufficiency history dates back to 06/2006 when he was hospitalized for an HIV-related issue. He is unsure of the exact reason for that hospitalization, but he was diagnosed with renal insufficiency and was followed in our Renal Clinic for about a year. During that time, his baseline creatinine ranged from 3.2 to 3.3. At diagnosis, he was noncompliant with his HAART regimen. He has since been compliant with HIV treatment and is under the care of Dr. Y in our Infectious Disease Clinic. He is currently on a three-drug antiretroviral therapy. His last CD4 count in 03/2008 was 350. He has not experienced HIV complications since his last visit to our clinic. He is also followed by Dr. Z at the outpatient VA Clinic here in ABCD, though he has not seen her in about a year. The patient has an AV fistula placed in late 2006. The latest blood work I have, dated 06/11/2008, shows a serum creatinine of 3.8, indicating a GFR of 22, and potassium of 5.9. These labs, drawn by his infectious disease doctor, prompted the recommendation for further evaluation at our clinic. The patient’s only complaint at this time is difficulty sleeping. He was prescribed Ambien by his primary care doctor, but it has not significantly alleviated his insomnia. He reports trouble falling asleep. Ambien allows him to sleep for about two hours before he wakes again. He feels tired during the day but does not nap. He has no history of excessive snoring or apneic episodes. He does not fall asleep at work or while driving. He has never had a formal sleep study. He continues to work in sales at a local butcher shop.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Renal. His serum creatinine is progressively worsening. His creatinine was 3.2 the last time we saw him in 05/2007 and is 4.3 today, indicating a GFR of 19. This is stage IV chronic kidney disease. He has vascular access, which is ready for use. He is experiencing some difficulty sleeping, possibly early uremia signs. No other uremia signs or symptoms are present. I will coordinate with the dialysis educator to get the patient into dialysis teaching classes. He has received dialysis teaching literature but has not enrolled in classes. I encouraged him to continue exercising his right forearm. I will also contact the transplant coordinator to evaluate him for a possible transplant. Given the progression of his chronic kidney disease, dialysis may be needed soon.
2. Hypertension. I added labetalol 100 mg b.i.d. to his antihypertensive regimen. He shows no volume overload signs, though if he does in the future, his Lasix could be increased. The goal blood pressure would be less than 130/80.
3. Hyperkalemia. I will instruct him on a low-potassium diet and decrease his valsartan to 20 mg daily. He will return in one week for potassium recheck. If potassium remains elevated, dialysis initiation may be necessary.
4. Bone metabolism. His PTH is elevated, so I am adding PhosLo 800 mg t.i.d. with meals. His corrected calcium is 9.7, and I would like to avoid calcium-containing phosphate binders in this situation.
5. Acid base. His bicarbonate is 18, and I will start sodium bicarbonate 650 mg three tablets t.i.d.
6. Anemia. His hemoglobin is at goal for this stage of chronic kidney disease. His iron stores are adequate.",Hallucinated, Nephrology,MTSamples,9.7

INDICATION: Pain in the sacroiliac joint.

INFORMED CONSENT: The procedure's risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. The patient had the opportunity to inquire about the procedure, its indications, and associated risks. Risks discussed included infection, bleeding, allergic reactions, dural puncture, headache, nerve or spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects due to possible vascular entry of medications. I also informed the patient of potential reactions to medications used during the procedure, including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids. The patient was informed both verbally and in written form. The patient comprehended the informed consent and chose to proceed with the procedure.

PROCEDURE: Oxygen saturation and vital signs were continuously monitored throughout the procedure. The patient remained conscious to provide feedback. The x-ray technician was instructed and supervised in operating the fluoroscopy machine. The patient was positioned prone on the treatment table with a pillow under the chest and head turned. The skin over the treatment area was cleansed with Betadine and covered with sterile drapes, leaving an opening for needle insertion. Fluoroscopy was utilized to identify the sacrum and sacroiliac joints for needle guidance. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine.

Using fluoroscopy, a 20-gauge 10-mm bent Teflon-coated needle was gently guided to the groove between the SAP and the sacrum for the dorsal ramus of L5, and the lateral border of the posterior sacral foramen for the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3.

Frequent relocations led to him being bullied in new settings. Mr. T described himself as rebellious during his teenage years but denied any major socialization issues or learning disabilities. His stepfather was verbally abusive and committed suicide when Mr. T was 18. After high school, Mr. T worked at Dana Corporation for a few years and later as an energy auditor.

At times he showed some involuntary movements that would be more akin to a resting tremor.  There was no psychomotor retardation, but there was some mild psychomotor excitement.  His speech was clear, concise, but pressured.  His attitude was overly negative and his mood was significant for moderate depression, anxiety, anhedonia and loneliness, and mild evidence of anger.  There was no evidence of euphoria or diurnal mood variation.  His affective expression was restricted range, but there was no evidence of lability.  At times, his affective tone and facial expressions were inappropriate to the interview.  There was no evidence of auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile or visceral hallucinations.  There was no evidence of illusions, depersonalizations, or derealizations.  Mr. T presented with a sequential and goal directed stream of thought.  There was no evidence of incoherence, irrelevance, evasiveness, circumstantiality, loose associations, or concrete thinking.  There was no evidence of delusions; however, there was some ambivalence, guilt, and self-derogatory thoughts.  There was evidence of concreteness for similarities and proverbs.  His intelligence was average.  His concentration was mildly impaired, and there was no evidence of distractibility.  He was oriented to time, place, person and situation.  There was no evidence of clouded consciousness or dissociation.  His memory was intact for immediate, recent, and remote events.,He presented with poor appetite, easily fatigued, and decreased libidinal drive, as well as excessive somnolence.  There was a moderate preoccupation with his physical health pertaining to his headaches.  His judgment was poor for finances, family relations, social relations, employment, and, at this time, he had no future plans.  Mr. T's insight is somewhat moderate as he is aware of his contribution to the problem.  His motivation for getting well is good as he accepts offered treatment, complies with recommended treatment, and seeks effective treatments.  He has a well-developed empathy for others and capacity for affection.,There was no evidence of entitlement, egocentricity, controllingness, intimidation, or manipulation.  His credibility seemed good.  There was no evidence for potential self-injury, suicide, or violence.  The reliability and completeness of information was very good, and there were no barriers to communication.  The information gathered was based on the patient's self-report and objective testing and observation.  His attitude toward the examiner was neutral and his attitude toward the examination process was neutral.  There was no evidence for indices of malingering as there was no marked discrepancy between claimed impairment and objective findings, and there was no lack of cooperation with the evaluation or poor compliance with treatment, and no evidence of antisocial personality disorder.,IMPRESSIONS: , Major Depressive Disorder, single episode,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care as well as psychotherapy.  At this time, the excessive amount of psychiatric symptoms would impede Mr. T from seeking employment.  Furthermore, it appears that the primary precipitating event had occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was fired from his job after being harassed for over a year.  As Mr. T placed his entire identity and sense of survival on his work, this was a deafening blow to his psychological functioning.  Furthermore, it only appears logical that this would precipitate a major depressive episode.","IDENTIFYING DATA: , Mr. T is a 45-year-old white male.,CHIEF COMPLAINT: , Mr. T presented with significant muscle tremors, persistent headaches, excessive nervousness, difficulty concentrating, and an inability to maintain focus. His confidence and self-esteem are markedly low. He reported excessive sleepiness, extremely low energy levels, a lack of motivation, and a disinterest in personal activities. He has experienced suicidal ideation, but it is currently in remission. Additionally, he continues to have feelings of hopelessness and crying spells. Mr. T indicated these symptoms began approximately two months ago.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , On March 25, 2003, Mr. T lost his job following an incident where he claimed to have been harassed by a coworker. This coworker confronted Mr. T in a very aggressive manner, placing his face directly in front of Mr. T and spitting on him while calling him derogatory names. Mr. T retaliated by attempting to hit the other employee, leading to his dismissal. Mr. T stated he had reported the harassment to his supervisor but was told to ""deal with it."" There are no other significant stressors in Mr. T's life currently or in recent months. Mr. T stated that his work was his entire life and he based his identity on his work ethic. Mr. T had been a process engineer at Plum Industries for the past 14 years.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:, There is no record of psychiatric hospitalizations or interventions other than a recent visit to Mr. T's family physician, Dr. B, where Mr. T was started on Lexapro at an unknown dose. Mr. T is currently under the care of Dr. J for psychotherapy, which began in April 2003.,PAST PSYCHIATRIC REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:, Mr. T denied any history of depressive, anxiety, or psychotic disorders during his childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. He denied any suicide attempts or severe suicidal or homicidal ideation. Mr. T also stated that his family psychiatric history is unremarkable.,SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY:, Mr. T reported using alcohol following his divorce in 1993 but has abstained for the last two years. No other substance abuse was noted.,LEGAL HISTORY: , Mr. T is facing pending charges related to the aforementioned incident.,MEDICAL HISTORY: , Mr. T denied any hospitalizations, surgeries, or current medication use for heart, lung, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal, neurological diseases, closed head injuries, endocrine issues, infections, blood, or muscular diseases, except for having a hiatal hernia and hypercholesterolemia. He also reports having a rare condition of inverted spleen syndrome.,PERSONAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY: , Mr. T was born in Dwyne, Missouri, with no complications during birth. He was initially raised by both parents, who separated when he was young. From age seven, he was raised by his mother and stepfather and did not maintain a relationship with his biological father. Due to frequent relocations, Mr. T was often bullied in new environments. He described himself as a rebellious teenager but denied significant socialization issues or learning disabilities requiring special education. Mr. T's stepfather was verbally abusive and committed suicide when Mr. T was 18. He graduated from high school and worked at Dana Corporation for two to three years, then as an energy auditor for a gas company. He became a homemaker while his wife worked for Chrysler for about two years. Mr. T was married for eleven years and divorced in 1993. He has a son who is now 20. After homemaking, Mr. T worked in his mother's restaurant and later for Borg-Warner Corporation for one to two years before joining Plum Industries, where he rose to lead engineer over 14 years.,Mental Status Exam: Mr. T appeared hypervigilant, with appropriate eye contact, and tense motor behavior. He exhibited involuntary movements akin to a resting tremor. There was no psychomotor retardation but mild psychomotor excitement. His speech was clear and concise, though pressured. His attitude was overly negative, and his mood showed moderate depression, anxiety, anhedonia, loneliness, and mild anger. There was no euphoria or diurnal mood variation. His affective expression was restricted, without lability. At times, his affective tone and facial expressions were inappropriate for the interview. There was no evidence of hallucinations of any kind, illusions, depersonalizations, or derealizations. Mr. T had a sequential and goal-directed thought process, without incoherence, irrelevance, evasiveness, circumstantiality, loose associations, or concrete thinking. There were no delusions, but some ambivalence, guilt, and self-derogatory thoughts were present. He showed concreteness in similarities and proverbs. His intelligence was average, with mildly impaired concentration and no distractibility. He was oriented to time, place, person, and situation, with intact memory for immediate, recent, and remote events. He had poor appetite, fatigue, decreased libidinal drive, and excessive somnolence, with moderate preoccupation regarding his headaches. His judgment was poor concerning finances, family, social relations, and employment, and he had no future plans. Mr. T's insight was moderate as he recognized his contribution to the problem. His motivation for recovery was good, as he accepted and complied with treatment, seeking effective solutions. He demonstrated empathy and capacity for affection, without entitlement, egocentricity, controlling behavior, intimidation, or manipulation. His credibility was good, with no evidence of self-injury, suicide, or violence risk. Information reliability and completeness were excellent, with no communication barriers. The information was based on self-report, objective testing, and observation. His attitude toward the examiner and examination was neutral, with no malingering indicators, marked discrepancies, or poor compliance with treatment, and no antisocial personality disorder evidence.,IMPRESSIONS: , Major Depressive Disorder, single episode,RECOMMENDATIONS AND PLAN: , I recommend Mr. T continue with psychopharmacologic care and psychotherapy. The excessive psychiatric symptoms currently hinder Mr. T from seeking employment. The primary precipitating event appears to have occurred on March 25, 2003, when Mr. T was dismissed after prolonged harassment. As Mr. T's identity and sense of self were heavily tied to his work, this event significantly impacted his psychological well-being, likely triggering a major depressive episode.",Hallucinated, Psychiatry / Psychology,MTSamples,9.9
