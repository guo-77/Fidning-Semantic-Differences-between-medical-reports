This is a LLMs(Large Language Models) project about using different LLMS including ChatGpt,Deepseek,Gemini and specialized-field model like ClinicalBERT/BioBERT to find differences between similar medical reports.

These reports are composed of one synthetic report (generating by prompt engineering with LLMS or by script(adding/deleting) specific words) and one original report from kaggle open source dataset.
